ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the @MooreICL-UBC GitHub Organization!

In our lab, we endeavor to conduct applied community and ecosystem ecology research and practice conservation at various scales while incorporating the values and needs of local communities directly into our work. Our lab is located at the University of British Columbia - Vancouver, with joint appointments in the Forest & Conservation Sciences and Botany Departments, and affiliated status with the Institute of Resources, Environment, and Sustainability as well as the Biodiversity Research Centre. More info can be found on our website: https://www.inclusiveconservationlab.com/

This GitHub organization was created to be our central location for pooling and archiving project data associated with the ICL. Info on suggested project directory, folder structure, and naming conventions can be found in this main README.github repository. More specific project READMEs & specific project descriptions can be found in the respective project repositories.
